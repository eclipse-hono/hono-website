      <description>Eclipse Hono™&amp;rsquo;s components are provided as container images which can be run on arbitrary container orchestration platforms. The Helm package manager can be used to install Hono to a Kubernetes cluster by means of the chart maintained in the Eclipse IoT Packages™ chart repository.
Please refer to the chart&amp;rsquo;s README for instructions regarding installation and configuration.</description>

      <title>OpenShift / OKD</title>
      <link>https://www.eclipse.org/hono/docs/deployment/openshift/</link>

      <description>The OpenShift specific deployment using the source-to-image (S2I) model has been dropped in Hono version 1.0 in favor of the Helm charts and the Eclipse IoT Packages™ project.
You can still deploy to OpenShift and OKD, using the Helm charts. And you can also use routes to expose services. Deploying using S2I is also still possible, however the Hono project simply no longer provides out-of-the box scripts for doing so.</description>

      <title>Limiting Resource Usage</title>
      <link>https://www.eclipse.org/hono/docs/deployment/resource-limitation/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Deploying Eclipse Hono™ to a container orchestration platform is easy thanks to the provided Docker images.
This page provides some guidance for configuring the resource consumption of these containers in order to make sure
that they get enough memory and CPU to run properly, but to also make sure that individual containers do not use up
all the resources causing other containers to starve.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
