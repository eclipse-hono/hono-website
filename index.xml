      <description>Binaries Eclipse Hono&amp;rsquo;s service components are provided by means of pre-built Docker images available from Docker Hub. These container images can be deployed to popular container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes and OpenShift.
The Eclipse IoT Packages project hosts the Hono Helm chart which can be used to install the most recent release of Hono to a Kubernetes cluster using the Helm package manager. Please refer to the deployment guide for installation instructions.</description>
