This repository contains the (generated) plain HTML website of the Eclipse Hono project.

A periodically running build job creates the (static) HTML pages found in this repository using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) from the
source files in [Hono's main repository](https://github.com/eclipse-hono/hono/tree/master/site).

Pull requests and/or issues concerning the web site should therefore be created in [Hono's main repository](https://github.com/eclipse-hono/hono).
